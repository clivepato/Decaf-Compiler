#Compiler

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my compiler for the imaginary programming language Decaf there are many variations for this Assignment so it is very likely you will see different ones online because but for my one I have used java. I have done and and tested my Lexer and Parser in order to see if my rules accept legal expression and reject illegal ones.

I also worked on some of the semantic analysis rules.
